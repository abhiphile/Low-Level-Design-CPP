# Low-Level Design (LLD) in C++

Welcome to the **Low-Level Design (LLD) in C++** repository! This repository is a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing various low-level design concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), SOLID principles, Design Patterns, UML diagrams, and practical mini-projects to demonstrate these concepts.

## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a clear and practical understanding of low-level design concepts in C++. It includes code examples, explanations, UML diagrams, and mini-projects to help reinforce these concepts.

## Features

- Comprehensive OOP concepts with C++ examples.
- Detailed explanation and implementation of SOLID principles.
- Classic and modern design patterns in C++.
- UML diagrams for visualizing the design.
- Mini-projects to practice and apply the learned concepts.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- A basic understanding of C++ programming

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhiphile/Low-Level-Design-CPP
cd Low-Level-Design-CPP
```

Compile and run the examples:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 path/to/your/file.cpp -o output
./output
```

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Abstraction**

Each concept is explained with examples and source code files.

## SOLID Principles

The repository includes C++ implementations and examples of the following SOLID principles:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

## Design Patterns

This section includes the implementation of various design patterns in C++:

- **Creational Patterns** (Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype)
- **Structural Patterns** (Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy)
- **Behavioral Patterns** (Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor)

Each pattern is explained with examples, UML diagrams, and C++ code.

## UML Diagrams

UML diagrams are provided to visualize:

- Class Hierarchies
- Relationships between classes (Inheritance, Association, Aggregation, Composition)
- Sequence Diagrams for specific operations

## Mini Projects

The repository includes several mini-projects that apply the concepts learned:

- **Bank Management System**
- **Library Management System**
- **E-commerce Cart System**
- **Parking Lot System**

Each mini-project includes:

- Requirements and problem statement
- UML diagrams
- Detailed C++ code implementation
